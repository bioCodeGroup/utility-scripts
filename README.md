# Utility scripts for biological data

This repository contains scripts that the Bio Code Group wrote that
are used to automate general lab computational tasks.

The main purpose of this repository is to practice programming through
projects that provide useful utilities for biological data. While many
of these are written in other groups as well, it provides a good starting
point for new students to familiarize themselves with biological data
and using Python to solve problems or automate tasks.

### Proposed ideas: 
* qSeq-FastQ converter
* demultiplex libraries

### Participating
If you are a student at CSU in biology interested in practicing Python 
via project-based learning, please get in touch!
